Lesson 1 – Exploring the Earth System
Lesson 1

Exploring the Earth System


In this Lesson you will learn about the Earth system and its four major parts.  As you read today’s text, take notes using the Main Idea and Detail system.  

Before reading, make a table in your Science Notebook.  Draw a vertical line down the center of the paper.  The column on the left should be titled “Main Idea”; the column on the right should be titled “Detail Notes”.  

As you read, write the main idea (Hint: look at headings) in the Main Idea column.  As they learn details about this idea, they should record these ideas in the “Detail Notes” column.

To record new vocabulary, use word triangles.  For each new vocabulary word, you should draw a triangle.  This triangle should be divided into 3 rows: the bottom row should have the word and definition, the middle row should have a complete sentence that correctly uses the word, and the top row should include a picture to represent the word.  

See an example below:

Word Triangle




Continue to create word triangles for each new vocabulary word you encounter as you read.

After you have finished today’s reading, complete the Lesson review activities.

Exploring the Earth System     

Have you ever seen a terrarium?



Take a look at the picture.

The bowl separates the inside of the terrarium from the outside world.

What do you think might happen if just one part of this terrarium was taken away? 

What would happen if it was placed in a dark cabinet?

The Four Parts of the Earth System

A terrarium is a simple system. A system is an organized group of parts that work together to form a whole.  In order to understand a system, you need to be able to recognize all of the parts and how these parts work together.  Each part of the terrarium works together much like each part of the Earth system work together.

The terrarium is a closed system – so is the Earth.  They are both closed systems because matter cannot enter or leave.  While matter cannot leave the system, energy can flow in and out.  Much like light and heat can flow through the glass of the terrarium, sunlight and heat can enter and leave the Earth through the atmosphere.

The Earth system is made up of four connected parts:  the atmosphere (the Earth’s air), the hydrosphere (the Earth’s water), the biosphere (the Earth’s living things), and the geosphere (the Earth’s interior, rocks, and soil).  Each of these parts is an open system, but they combine to create one large, closed system called Earth.

Atmosphere

The atmosphere is the mixture of gases that surround and protect the Earth.  The atmosphere is made up of many gases.  Our atmosphere is made up of primarily nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), but there are many other gases, such as carbon dioxide, and water vapor in the atmosphere.

Today, scientists use devices such as weather balloons, specially equipped planes, and satellite images to view the atmosphere and collect data. This data shows scientists that the Earth’s atmosphere interact with the other parts of the Earth system to form the weather patterns that move around the globe. Studying these patterns allows scientists to more accurately predict the weather. 
	
Hydrosphere

The hydrosphere is made up of all the water on Earth.  This water can be found in oceans, lakes, rivers, glaciers, streams, and underground.  Water covers nearly threequarters of the Earth’s surface.  Of all the water in the hydrosphere, only about 3 percent is fresh water and almost 70 percent of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps.

During the past 50 years, scientists have used technology to study the water deep in the oceans.  They use deep-sea vehicles, special buoys, satellite images, and diving suits to study the Earth’s oceans. These studies have lead to the discovery of layers of cold and warm water in the oceans. These layers circulate and form warm and cold ocean currents.  The currents then interact with wind patterns in the atmosphere and affect the weather.

Biosphere

The biosphere includes all life on Earth – life in the air, in the waters, and on land. The biosphere can be studied in a variety of ways. Satellite images allow scientists to track changes in the Earth’s plant and animal life. They also allow the study of rainforests and other complex environments without damaging them. Scientists have learned a lot about how the biosphere interacts with the other parts of the Earth system.  

Geosphere

The geosphere includes all of the features on Earth’s surface-- this includes the continents, islands, and sea floor – and everything below the surface.  The geosphere is made up of several different layers.

	The crust is the part of the Earth that we live on; it is a thin, rocky shell that includes the continents and sea floor.  The mantle is just below the crust and is made up of a thick layer of hot rock.  Below the mantle is the outer core.  The outer core is made of molten metal, mostly iron.  The final layer is the core.  The core is solid metal, again, mostly iron.
People have been studying the surface of the geosphere for hundreds of years.  With new technology, scientists can use satellite images, sound waves, and computer modeling to create accurate pictures of what happens below the surface as well.  These images show that the Earth constantly changes.  Some changes are rapid and very noticeable – like the eruption of a volcano – others take millions of years to develop – like the birth of a new island.

The Four Parts of the Earth System All Shape the Planet’s Surface

The Earth’s surface is constantly changing.  It is worn away, built up, and reshaped every single day by the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere. The crust is the part of the Earth that we live on; it is a thin, rocky shell that includes the continents and sea floor.  The mantle is just below the crust and is made up of a thick layer of hot rock.  Below the mantle is the outer core and this core is made of molten metal, mostly iron.  The final layer is the inner core which is solid metal, again - mostly iron. Even the hardest stones cannot withstand the forces of wind and water.  The atmosphere and hydrosphere work together to carve huge formations such as the Grand Canyon in Arizona, or the Great Arches in Utah.



Over millions of years, rain, wind, and flowing water carve away at the rock until these formations are left behind.  The geosphere changes the shape of the Earth’s surface as landmasses move and push together.  This movement can cause earthquakes, build mountains, and form volcanoes.  Plants, animals, and human beings also change the Earth’s surface.  Animals often help to make soil more fertile, and throughout history, people have cleared land for farms or dammed rivers.

Each of us plays a part in changing the surface of the Earth.  Each time you go for a bike ride or walk across a field, you are changing the surface of the land.  Feet and tires dig into the dirt, wear away plants, and expose soil to sunlight, wind, and water.  Over time, if you take the same path every day, you will wear your own path into the land.

Lesson Wrap Up: Think of ways that you help to shape the Earth’s surface and ask yourself if these positive or negative changes?
