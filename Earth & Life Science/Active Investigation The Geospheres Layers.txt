Lesson 2

Active Investigation: The Geospheres Layers

Student Assignment: In the last Lesson, you learned about the layers of the geosphere.  In today’s activity, you will review and apply this knowledge to a different object – an apple slice.  

Procedure:

1. You will be using a quarter of an apple (that your instructor has sliced) as a model of the geosphere.

2. Hold the apple slice and observe it carefully.  Compare the slice with the diagram of the geosphere found in the previous lesson (Lesson 1).

3. Draw a diagram of the apple and label it with the names of the layers of the geosphere.

4. Document: In writing, explain how the parts of the apple are similar to the layers of the geosphere. Challenge: What other objects can you think of that would make a good model of the geospheres layers?  Think of at least two items you can find in your house that would make good models.  Provide diagrams of both models.  Be sure to draw the object in its natural state and compare the parts to the layers of the geosphere.


Lesson Wrap Up: When you have completed this activity, present your findings to your instructor and discuss your ideas.
